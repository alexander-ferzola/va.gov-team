# Sign in Service
## Overview: (Provide a high level description of the product/set of features)
Sign in Service is a client authentication service that provides a highly reliable, efficient, and secure user authentication experience to VA.gov and other VA applications. The Sign in Service is highly lean, cost effective, and transparent. It introduces the concept of ultimate accountability throughout the authentication process, with monitors and logging providing an auditable insight into every user authentication.
## Problem Statement: (Describe what problem weâ€™re going to address with this product)
The current VA.gov authentication solution is cumbersome and opaque. It provides a less-than-ideal authentication for Veterans, while costing the VA significantly in operation costs. Additionally, it is difficult to understand issues when they do arise, and fixes may take weeks, or even months, to apply.
The Sign in Service was created to solve these shortcomings, while adding numerous features. It was designed with the idea that Veteran authentication should be as secure and transparent as possible, leveraging modern design and code practices to allow for a service that can be future-facing and effective.
