# va.gov Login SLOs

## Overview: 
Determining and establishing the Service Level Objective (SLO) targets we want to hit for Veterans logging into va.gov with the ultimate goal of continuously improving the login process to va.gov.

## Problem Statement: 
We do not currently have any current SLOs for va.gov logins, and creating them will help us monitor and improve the Veteran login experience.

## Relevant Documents:

## What's In Scope: 
For this first iteration, the focus will be on:
* Authentication Logging & Monitoring
  * Availibility
  * Response Time
* Incident Response


## Out of Scope: (for this iteration)


## Use Cases:
- As a Veteran, I should be able to login to va.gov 99.9999% of the time, as measured monthly by the _SIS Authorize_ dashboard in datadog. If the endpoint goes down, it will be treated as a P1, and fixed immediately.

- As a Veteran, I should have to wait no longer than ***HOW LONG?*** to get a result when I try to login to va.gov, as measured monthly by the _SIS Authorize_ in datadog.

## Assumptions:
* 

## Solution Approach: 
* First, we will have to determine the Service Level Indicators (SLIs) for each of our focus area. That will help up understand how to target the SLOs.
