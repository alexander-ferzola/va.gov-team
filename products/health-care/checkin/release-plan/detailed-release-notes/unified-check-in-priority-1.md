## Description

The Unified Check-in initiative comprises a number of enhancements to the online check-in applications. These enhancements aim to reduce the confusion among Veterans and staff of the difference between and purpose for the pre-Check-in and check-in workflows. These enhancements consist of a number of planned Prioritys, each of which will help to solve this problem. All enhancements may not necessarily be needed to achieve the desired outcome, which is to increase the use of the online check-in applications. The team will monitor feedback after each Priority and work with our VA Product Owner to determine when our objective has been achieved.

This priority includes a new landing page that follows the same task-based design pattern in both Online Check-in and Pre-Check-in. Veterans will have a better understanding of the tasks they need to complete before a health appointment and the differences between the two applications will become irrelevant.
