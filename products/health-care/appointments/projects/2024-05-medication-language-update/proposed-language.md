# Medication Review - Proposed Language

The medication review language will appear on most (possibly all) scheduled appointments. It should be short, to the point,and easy to scan. Veterans will not need to read this content every time they open an appointment. It should be available as needed.


## Proposal

**Prepare for your appointment**

Bring a list of all *your medications*, including these types:  
- Prescriptions from VA and non-VA providers
- Over-the-counter medications
- Vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies

Include the doses (amounts) you take of *each medication* and how often you take them.

Tell your provider about these things:
- Changes in the medications you're taking or how often you're taking them
- Changes in how your medications affect you, _including any new side effects_
- _Any allergies or reactions you've had to your current or past medications_
- Other health care you're receiving from other VA facilities or from providers outside VA

### How it appears in the UI
