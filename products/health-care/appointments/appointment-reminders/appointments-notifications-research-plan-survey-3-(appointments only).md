# Research Plan for [Appointments team, Appointment notifications, 9-27-2023]

## Background
The appointments team is thinking of ways to better the future appointment notifications, which is a crucial part of the authenticated experience for managing their health. We know that Veterans rely on different forms of notifications to be on top of managing their appointments, and staff at VA facilities use different systems to send out notifications. There could be excessive notifications, no notifications, or inconsistent notifications about the same appointment. From past studies, we know that systems are disconnected, and we need to streamline how we send out notifications, which requires additional technical discovery. The focus of this research is to understand Veterans’ preferences on appointment notifications, define the desired future state of appointment notifications, and prioritize what notifications experience the appointment team should build first.

### OCTO Priorities 
This research supports:

- Integrate health portal features into VA.gov
- Enhance Veterans' personalized online experience

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran’s journey: 

- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals	
The focus of this study is to figure out what notifications Veterans find the most helpful for them when managing their appointments and appointment-related tasks so that our team can prioritize what to build and test first among the list of notifications below.

Here’s a list of appointment notifications that include what exists today and what we expect Veterans might need: 
- Routine reminders to schedule appointments (e.g., annual physical exam)
- Request submitted
- Appointments successfully scheduled confirmation (with dates, time, and location and how to modify)
- Referral
- Appointments denied or for some reason could not be scheduled (with next steps, and why (e.g., community care eligibility requirements)
- Unable to contact Veterans to discuss the appointment
- Reminder for upcoming appointments
- Notify early appointment slot openings
- Confirm and fill out pre-check-in and any questionnaires
- Cancellation by VA
- Cancellation confirmation by Veterans
- Any changes to appointments
- Reschedule confirmation
- Updates on pending appointments
- Check-in reminder
- Checked in confirmation
- Next steps for failed check-in
- File for travel reimburse
- Travel claims submission confirmation (submission confirmation and failed submission with next steps)
- Travel claim approved
- AVS ready to view
- Outstanding co-pay bills

The second goal is to find out how Veterans would like to receive notifications, for example, notifications can be sent separately, or notifications can be combined and sent in one email. 

### Outcome
This research will inform updates to the appointment notifications experience and help prioritize what appointment notifications to build first.

### Research questions
1. Which appointment notifications are helpful for Veterans the most and the least?
2. How do Veterans prefer to receive their notifications?
3. What formats (text, email, phone call, or push notifications) do Veterans prefer to receive and for which notifications?
4. How do Veterans feel about receiving appointments and appointment-related notifications?

### Hypothesis
- Some Veterans might not know how to manage their notifications, which causes them to receive no notifications or too many notifications.
- For a straightforward appointment (without canceling or rescheduling or other difficulties), Veterans only need 4 notifications, which are a reminder, check-in, AVS, and money-related (e.g., copay and travel pay) notifications.
- Veterans expect to receive email, text, and phone call notifications.
- Veterans might want to add their caregivers’ emails and phone numbers to receive notifications. 

## Methodology	

#### Survey - Kano Analysis

Using Optimal Workshop, we will conduct an unmoderated study in which participants are invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants will be sent a link to a survey activity that contains, respectively, 20-25 questions  (or less than 15 mins) for Veterans that may experience when getting appointment notifications. 

We would like to get complete responses from at least 35 Veterans, in distinct cohorts of fewer than 10 participants per cohort (per PRA). Each cohort will access the study using a unique URL. 

### Location
This will be a survey that participants fill out remotely and asynchronously.

- [Cohort 7](https://dj540s05.optimalworkshop.com/questions/33i56qgt?token=7)

	
## Recruitment	
We will work with Perigean to handle the recruitment, scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

### Recruitment approach
We will ask Perigean to recruit 63 people using the cohorts below to get at least 35 completes.

### Recruitment criteria

We will schedule a total of 24 Veterans for an expected completion rate of 18-20 interviews. 

•	All have a computer or mobile device and are willing to use it to complete the activity. 
•	All must have been to a VA health care facility for medical appointments for themself or a Veteran that they care for in the last 12 months.
