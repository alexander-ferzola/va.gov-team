# Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov secondary navigation, October/November 2023

## Background

As we move My HealtheVet (MHV) to VA.gov, we discover that there are problems with the current VA.gov secondary navigation system. It is not only inaccessible and unintuitive but also doesn't support complex navigations within all the tools of the MHV on VA.gov. This study aims to give us more context to those problems from Veterans' perspectives and understand what aspects of primary and secondary navigations are confusing to Veterans by looking at how they use tools within MHV on VA.gov when completing health management tasks. 

### OCTO Objectives
This research supports the following OCTO objectives: 

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals 	

The goal of this study is to help us better understand how Veterans expect to be able to navigate MHV on VA.gov. This understanding will help us develop the most effective navigational strategy for the product.

### Outcome

This research will inform us of users' pain points when using the current and the new secondary navigation, which give us ideas on how to improve and iterate on the new design so the secondary navigation can be ready when all the tools are available on MHV on VA.gov in Phase 2. 

### Research questions

* How does the current secondary navigational pattern used across VA.gov align with users’ expectations? 
* In what situations might a user want to navigate back to the MHV on the VA.gov landing page? 
* In what situations might a user want to jump directly from one tool to another? 

### Hypotheses 
* Users want to be able to jump from any part of MHV on VA.gov back to the MHV on the VA.gov landing page. They will do this by clicking on the VA logo at the top left of the website. 
* Users expect to be able to directly navigate from a child (or sub-tool, e.g. Sent of Secure messages) of a tool to a child of another tool.
* Mobile users will default to using the "menu" button in the primary navigation bar when trying to navigate from one part of MHV on VA.gov to another.
* Mobile users will rarely use breadcrumbs to navigate. 

## Method

### Interviews
We will conduct remote interviews with Zoom. These interviews will include questions documenting users’ process of navigating to and within My HealtheVet, the mental models they use to find certain information, and their expectations related to health-specific tasks. The interviews will consist of a combination of tasks and direct questions. 

### Location
Data collection will be remote and conducted using Zoom.
