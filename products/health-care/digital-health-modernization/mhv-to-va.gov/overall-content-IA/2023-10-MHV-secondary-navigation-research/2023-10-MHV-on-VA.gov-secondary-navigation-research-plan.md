# Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov secondary navigation, October/November 2023

## Background

As we move My HealtheVet (MHV) to VA.gov, we discover that there are problems with the current VA.gov secondary navigation system. It is not only inaccessible and unintuitive, but also doesn't support complex navigations within all the tools of the MHV. This study aims to give us more context to those problems by investigating the secondary navigational strategies users use when completing health management tasks on MHV on VA.gov and to improve the secondary navigation. 


### OCTO Objectives
This research supports the following OCTO objectives: 

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals 	

The goal of this study is to help us understand users' reactions and behaviors regarding how they use secondary navigational strategies to complete key health tasks on MHV on VA.gov and whether users can effectively complete them, and to decide on an alternative that is accessible and intuitive. 

### Outcome

This research will inform us of users' pain points when using the current secondary navigational strategies, which give us ideas on how to improve the side navigation and iterate on the new design. 

### Research questions

1. What are users' reactions to the variations in navigational strategies (side navigation, breadcrumbs, and direct links) across the different products (appointments, secure messages, medications, and medical records) on MHV on VA.gov? 
2. Do users use different navigational strategies with different products? Why, or why now? 
3. What, if any, specific aspects of the secondary navigation cause confusion or unintended behaviors amongst participants? 
4. How do participants react to and use the navigational strategies (e.g. use of AT), if at all? 
5. What alternatives might prove more accessible and intuitive for users with complex barriers? 

### Hypotheses 
- Users want to be able to navigate every part of MHV on VA.gov easily regardless of where they are.
- Mobile users struggle with current secondary navigation because "in this section" is not noticeable and it expands to a long list that is hard to scroll. 
  

## Method

### Interviews
We will conduct remote interviews with Zoom. These interviews will include questions documenting usersâ€™ process of navigating to and within My HealtheVet, the mental models they use to find certain information, and their expectations related to health-specific tasks. The interviews will consist of a combination of tasks and direct questions. 

### Location
Data collection will be remote and conducted using Zoom.
