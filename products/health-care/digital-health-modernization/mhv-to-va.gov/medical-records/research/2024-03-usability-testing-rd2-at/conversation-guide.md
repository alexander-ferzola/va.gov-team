## **Intro - 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! My name is \[NAME\]. I'm a usability researcher, and I work as part of a team that is improving the VA's websites and other resources for Veterans. We reach out to Veterans as we design these resources to get their input so we can help make sure we meet their needs.

Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If for any reason and at any time you would like to stop the session, or do not want to answer a question, that's no problem. Please let me know.

What screen reader will you be using for today’s session? _(If they state they will not be using a screen reader, please end the session and notify Perigean.)_

Before we begin, I want to make sure that you're comfortable with a few of my teammates assisting me on this call.

**AT USERS**

Our accessibility specialist is in the waiting room. Before I let them in, I want to let you know that they will be here to help us navigate any accessibility troubles we might have. They will also help us with any screen-reader troubleshooting we may need to do during this time. I’m going to let them into the session and have her introduce herself to you.

(_Let \__in)_

\___\__, do you mind (turning on your camera) and introducing yourself to \[PARTICIPANT\]?

Thank you.

There are a few of my teammates who would like to observe this session and help take notes so that we can accurately represent your feedback. We won't link any notes to your name or other personal information. The others are just here to observe. Do I have your permission to let them into the session?

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour (A11Y – 1.5hrs).** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans' needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- I will soon be sharing a link with you to the website we will be looking at today using your screen reader. This is a live site; it will behave as expected when you are on a typical website.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

# **Screen sharing instructions (AT USERS)**

As part of your participation in this session, you were provided with 2 documents that included login information for the website we will be looking at today.

In the document titled \[login Instructions\], we provided you with the link and login instructions, please proceed to open that document and retrieve that link, email and password

Have you ever shared your screen on Zoom before?

_(If yes – proceed to share link)_

_(If no): Have A11Y walk the participant through screen-sharing_

Our Accessibility specialist will help walk you through how to do this. Do you mind unmuting and walking \[PARTICIPANT\] through this, \[A11Y specialist\]?

**JAWS Screen Share**

- The first thing you need to do is put focus on the JAWS window – ALT + TAB
- JAWS - ALT + S – Screen share.
- Voiceover and NVDA – Tab to “More meeting controls”, then arrow down to “share screen” and “enter”.
- This puts you on “share sound” dialogue.
- Hit space, then tab over 3 times, then hit enter.

**Voiceover Screen Share**

- Put focus on the menu, swipe right until you get to “share”
- You cannot always hear Voiceover even when sound is shared.

# **Remote Control sharing instructions (NON-AT USERS)**

- I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. This allows you take control of my screen as if it were yours. The functionality will be similar to how you would use your computer. Does that sound ok?
- _\[Share your screen\]_. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? _\[Give mouse control\]_ Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?
  - _\[Veteran might need to use a mouse to move around the screen if trackpad does not work.\]_

## MOBILE SCREEN SHARE

I just sent you the link to access the platform in our chat. If you don’t mind clicking that link to open up the page.

(_Help users navigate to chat when needed)_

- Getting to chat is a similar process as earlier. In the bottom (top in iPad) of your screen, there is a row of bottoms, one of the options should say ‘chat’, you may need to click on the 3 dots (on smaller screens) to bring up more options.

_(Once link has been opened)_

- Since this is a live website, we are going to need to log into the account. I am going to walk you through how to do this by providing the username (which is an email) and a password.
- As you are probably aware, there are a few ways to log into your My HealtheVet website, for this sake of this study, please select the option “ID.me” to proceed.
- Whenever you are ready, I will present that login information to you.

_When ready, share the email and password using the military alphabet._

- Go ahead and click sign-in.
- It is going to ask for a 2-step authorization, but we have gone ahead to fill this out for you, so please click continue
- _On code page –_ Please proceed by clicking continue once again.

# **Participant Coaching**

Today we are trying to learn how a Veteran might use this product if they were on their own. Part of understanding how well this product works is to know what you, the user, are thinking and feeling while you are using it. As much as possible today, we would like you to say aloud anything you are thinking or feeling no matter how significant or insignificant you may think it is. Imagine that you are doing the tasks today and I am on the phone with you and can’t see your screen.

_\[for MHV users\]_ This is going to look slightly familiar, but please remember that this is a new design we are testing and some elements you might expect to be there will not and some you don’t expect will. I would like you to treat this entire website like it were not MHV at all.

Since we are trying to make this experience as realistic as possible, you may notice that at the top right the name Jamie. If this were your page, it would be your name, but for today you will notice Jamie at the top of your screen.

Are you ready to get started?
