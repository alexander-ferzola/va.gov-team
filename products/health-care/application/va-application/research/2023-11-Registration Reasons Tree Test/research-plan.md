# Research Plan for [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ Registration Reasons Tree Test, November 2023]

## Background

The paper form allows for Veterans to self-select the health care benefit type they want to apply for - Enrollment or Registration. On the backend in VES (Veteran Enrollment System), each person has a status and some can be Registration Only with a registration reason. 

The concept of registration and enrollment, if they are steps in the process or the same thing, was found to be confusing during the intial generative research with Veterans. Choosing between these labels did not align with the Veteran's mental model of going about health care eligibility process.

Looking at this from the perspective of registration reasons as scenarios Veterans may have when applying for health care benefits and completing a 10-10EZ, we want to learn the paths taken within VA.gov and if the Veteran reports going to the existing application or another location on the website.

### OCTO Priorities 

Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

### Veteran Journey
[Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)
- Getting out
- Starting up
	- Moment that matters: selecting health care coverage according to their individual set of needs
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
  


## Research Goals	

- Learn more about **WHERE** on VA.gov do Veterans expect to complete tasks related to registration reasons.
- Discover **WHAT** actions Veterans take prior to seeking care for registration reasons.
- Learn more about the Veteran's mental model of what they are getting when they sign up for their registration reason vs enrolling in VA health care. 


### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?
- We want to know if Veterans expect to access these scenarios through different areas on VA.gov or if for all reasons they go to the same starting point/application.
- Knowing this will guide the path on how to update the content of the 10-10EZ introduction page and knowing if other introduction pages/paths need to be accounted for registration mvp. 


### Research questions

**Learn more about WHERE on VA.gov do Veterans expect to complete tasks related to registration reasons.**
- Do Veterans navigate to the 10-10EZ for registration reasons?
- If somebody is looking to sign up  for [registration reason scenario] from VA, how would they do that?
- How easy is it for the Veterans to navigate to the [registration reason scenario] starting point?

**Discover WHAT actions Veterans take prior to seeking care for registration reasons.**
- Do Veterans mention offline channels as the preferred method of "registering" for these reasons?
- What do Veterans expect to happen next when registering for [registration reason scenario]?
- Do Veterans expect to have to take action (if needed) to enroll after registering?


**Learn more about the Veteran's mental model of what they are getting when they sign up for their registration reason vs enrolling in VA health care.**
- Do the registration reasons align with the Veterans' mental model of signing up for health care from the VA?
- Do Veterans expect to get only the [registration reason] they signed up for or more health care benefits in their application? 


### Hypothesis
- Hypothesis that for the appointment registration scenarios - like a C&P or toxic exposure exam - Veteran's will navigate to the disability claims or locations hubs in the tree test.
- Hypothesis that for service connected care, Veteran's will navigate to the health care hub and the apply for benefits node.
- We hypotheis that their expectation is getting the most the can due to their disability rating and that they are applying for the most they are eligible for.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
We will use Perigean to recruit participants into cohrots needed for unmoderated tree test study.

- 7 cohorts are only Veterans
- 1 cohort is Active Duty/Service Member


### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Total requested 72 / 35 total completed**
- 8 cohorts total / 9 participants per each cohort


**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 


- Mix of demographics (no more than 3 per category on race, age range) - per each cohort



Cohort 1
- What is your service connected disability rating? (must be over 50% to qualify)

Cohort 2
- What is your service connected disability rating? (must be between 30-40% to qualify)
- Not enrolled in VA health care

Cohort 3
- What is your service connected disability rating? (must be between 30-40% to qualify)
- Enrolled in VA health care
  
Cohort 4
- What is your service connected disability rating? (must be between 0-20% to qualify)
- Not enrolled in VA health care

Cohort 5
- What is your service connected disability rating? (must be between 0-20% to qualify)
- Enrolled in VA health care


Cohort 6
- Do you have a service connected disability? (must be NO to qualify, 0% rating)
- Not enrolled in VA health care


Cohort 6
- Do you have a service connected disability? (must be NO to qualify, 0% rating)

Cohort 8
- Current Active Duty / Service Member
- Discharge date in less than 365 days

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research: November ##-## 2023

### Length of sessions
* Session length: Unmoderated, 30 minutes or less
* Buffer time between sessions: N/A 
* Maximum Sessions per day: N/A
