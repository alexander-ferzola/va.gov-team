#  Research Plan for Integrated Veteran Care (IVC) Team, Form 10-7959f-1, February 2023 

## Background

This study will support the unauthenticated digital flow for Form 10-7959f-1 and the Foreign Medical Program (FMP). We will be building this as a new digital form, so there will be no familiarity from the perspective of the Veterans. However, we will specifically attempt to recruit participants familiar with the paper form and program.

[Product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/foreign-medical-program/10-7959f-1/10-7959f-1%20product%20outline.md)

### OCTO Priorities

* Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience
* Fast-track disability claims
* Drive OIT’s Digital Transformation Strategy

### Veteran Journey

* Starting up - Attending to health needs
* Taking care of myself - Managing primary care and chronic health issues, maintaining my health  
* Putting down roots - engaging VA to access benefits and services
* Retiring - taking care of my health
* Aging - managing my declining health

## Research Goals

* Test the usability of the current iteration of the 10-7959f-1 digital form
* Test high-level accessibility for the current iteration of the 10-7959f-1 digital form
* Gain insights related to participants’ experience with the current 10-7959f-1 process and FMP, which will inform efforts to address pain points discovered during stakeholder interviews

### Research questions

* Will users understand and be able to easily use the 10-7959f-1 digital form?
* What are the major accessibility issues we can remediate?
* What are major pain points users encounter with the 10-7959f-1 digital form or with the FMP? 

### Hypothesis

* Based on our understanding of current patterns and best practices for forms, the 10-7959f-1 digital form will be easy to understand and navigate.
* Based on our understanding of accessibility best practices, we believe the 10-7959f-1 digital form will be free of major design-related accessibility issues
* Based on research our team has done on previous forms, we think participants will mention pain points such as:
    * Lengthy processing time
    * Frustration with the lack of online submission options
    * For Veterans participating in the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) (also known as Chapter 31; formerly known as the VA Vocational Rehabilitation Program), frustration with not knowing what might be covered

## Methodology

This methodology will be a mixed-method approach, combining a usability study with a user interview. There will be 30-40 minutes of usability testing, utilizing the think-out-loud protocol to identify major issues with the digital form. 

The exit interview questions will be asked in the remaining 20-30 minutes, less any time it takes to prepare or troubleshoot for the participant. We want to ask these questions at the end to avoid any bias that may impact interactions with the prototype, and comments gathered through the execution of the think-out-loud protocol.

This method is appropriate for the goals of the research by addressing said goals directly. The maturity of the design should be appropriate to accommodate all of the aforementioned research. In order to clarify the limited accessibility research that we plan to do at this time, we will be using a version of the form that has been published to the staging site in this capacity. This will help us identify any major accessibility issues earlier in the process. This allows us to make corrections to those major issues before moving them into final code or production, potentially saving us significant rework and capacity.

### Location

Research will take place over Zoom.

### Research materials

For moderated usability tests:

### Recruitment approach

Our intended audience for this research is Veterans who are eligible for FMP. We will be utilizing Perigean to help us recruit our participants. We will use the lean maximum variation inclusive recruitment strategy outlined by OCTO.

### Recruitment criteria

We would like to work with Perigean to recruit for 12 full sessions.

**User groups:**

Cohort 1: 6 (of 12) Veterans who are eligible for FMP, but have not registered

Cohort 2: 6 (of 12) Veterans are registered for FMP

**Demographics:**

* At least 6 participants aged 55-64+
* At least 6 participants have a cognitive disability
* At least 3 participants live in a rural area
* At least 3 participants have no degree
* At least 2 participant is are women
* At least 5 participants are ex-pats (living abroad)
* At least 3 participants are of immigrant origin
* At least 2 participants are Black
* At least 2 participants are Hispanic
* At least 1 participant is Asian
* At least 1 participant is Native
* At least 1 participant is gay, lesbian, or bisexual
* At least 1 participant is transgender, nonbinary, gender fluid, gender queer, Two-Spirit (Indigenous only), or another gender beyond man or woman
* At least 1 participant is enrolled in both VR&E (Ch. 31) and FMP
* At least 4 participants use some assistive technology that **does not **require code to function fully 
* At least 6 participants on a mobile device (tablet okay)

### Screener questions

1. Do you have a VA-rated service-connected disability? 
    * _[Recruit if yes; if they say “no”, recruit if they say “yes” to the next program AND live abroad]_
2. Are you enrolled in the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) (Chapter 31, formerly the VA Vocational Rehabilitation Program)? 
    * _[Yes or no is okay]_
    * _If no to both question 1 and question 2, do not recruit_
3. Are you enrolled in the Foreign Medical Program (FMP)? 
    * Yes = Cohort 2
    * No or I don’t know = Cohort 1
4. (If they answered ‘yes’ to Question 1) When have you used your FMP benefits (check all that apply) _[Any are okay]:_
    * During a short trip abroad (i.e., a vacation)
    * During medical tourism
    * While you were living abroad
    * I have never used my benefits
