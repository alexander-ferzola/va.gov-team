# Create  Profile

## Notes
* Current system generates a new profile when a user logs in and is given a sec id by Access VA.  
    * If we are using VA Profile, maybe we can create/update a profile when the user submits their first inquiry.  This will allow us to collect the information we need to create a profile and allow the user to update their profile information as needed.
