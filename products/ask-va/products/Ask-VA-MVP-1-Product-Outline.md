## Ask VA MVP 1- Product Outline

---

## Overview
AVA on the modernized VA.gov platform will be a digital support channel that works with other tools and features on VA.gov and VA ecosystems to quickly and accurately answer submitters' questions. Submitters should feel it is easy and intuitive to submit their issues and receive adequate updates and information that results in a final resolution. Ultimately, we want AVA to feel part of a cohesive and submitter-centered approach to support.


## Problem Statement

Submitter should easily and intuitively be able to ask a question through Ask VA on VA.gov.
   - **Who**: The submitter - This could be the Veteran, their caregiver, their supporting personnel, or their dependents (authenticated or un-authenticated).
   - **What**: The current form design and content needs to better align with VA.gov design and accessibility standards for the submitter. 
   - **Why**: This will empower more Veterans to seek access to VA benefits and services.
   - **Where**: The form needs to reside in VA.gov so that it is easily locatable and can potentially integrate with other VA.gov applications (ex. Chatbot).

**How might we** create an inquiry form that is easier for Veterans and other users to ask VA a question online?

 
## Desired Submitter Outcomes

Form Design, and Content, Mobile-Friendly Experience, 508 Compliance

>It's easy for me to find Ask VA on VA.gov.\
>It's accessible for me.

Integrate with VA Profile
As a Veteran
>If I am authenticated, Information is pre-filled for me if it's available on VA Profile.\
>If I am authenticated, I am able to edit personal information on VA Profile and then come back to my inquiry form to finish asking my question on Ask VA.

## Desired Business Objectives

## Assumptions
- Improving the front-end of Ask VA will reduce the time it takes to submit an inquiry, increase the percentage of submitters that complete asking a question, and increase user satisfaction of the application.
- Transitioning Ask VA front-end to VA.gov design and content standards will improve user experience, and bring more cohesiveness with the other services that the VA offers.

## Solution Approach

Bring Ask VA up to VA.gov design standards (Front-End Updates)
- Update topics and categories based on content style guide (without changing form functionality and output).
- Update form questions based on content style guide (without changing form functionality and output).
- Update UI to reflect the VA Design System.
- Make it mobile-friendly.
- Do iterative submitter research to test usability of new form design and content updates.
- Make it 508 Compliant.

Implement form on VA.gov
- Understand current routing rules
- When Inquiry data is collected on VA.gov, the implementation will send this data to Dynamics CRM for the agents to answer the questions.
- Releasing this new form to a page on VA.gov
- Update the dashboard front-end to VA.gov design and content standards
