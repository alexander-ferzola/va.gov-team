# Conversation Guide
_Moderator note: Start recording & start the transcription._

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few background questions.

- Talk to me about your past experience using VA.gov?
- Could you tell me about the types of benefits you are receiving from the VA at this time? 
If they are getting disability compensation from the VA right now, ask:
- About how many conditions are you receiving benefits for?
- If you’re comfortable sharing this information, what are some of those conditions?

Great! Now let’s get into evaluating some prototypes.

## Scenario 1: Review currently rated conditions - 15 minutes

**If this is the 1st task:**
Your Tinnitus and Arthritis has gotten worse, so you’re coming to the website to determine what you should do next. You’d like to review what disability benefits you are already receiving. I’d like you to walk us through what you would do on this prototype. Please think aloud as much as you can while you are walking us through this process. And we’re not in a hurry, so take as much time as you would if you were actually doing this for yourself. 

**If this is the 2nd task:** 
In this scenario, your Tinnitus and Arthritis has gotten worse. You’re coming to the website to look for more information.

### Screen 1 (Start)
Do you have any questions before you start?
Go ahead and click Version 1.

_Note to modersator - switch between starting with 1 and 1a._

### Screen 2 (Authenticated Home) 
Talk me through what you would do on this screen if you wanted to learn more about your current condition ratings.

_Observe how the participant makes it to the rated disabilities screen…_

### Screen 3 (View my Rated Disabilities Screen)
I have a few questions for you on this screen.
- What is this screen telling you? What is your initial impression of it?
- What can you tell me about the conditions on this screen?
- What do you think about your eligibility for more benefits?
- Which conditions could you get more compensation for? 

_(1 only)_
- What does the phrase ‘highest schedular rating’ mean to you?
- What do you think would happen if you clicked that link?
- _Instruct participant to click on the link if they haven’t already_
  - What can you tell me about this explanation for maximum schedular rating?

_(1A only)_ 
- What do you think would happen if you clicked on that triangle symbol?
- _Instruct participant to expand the caret if they haven’t already_
- What can you tell me about this explanation of maximum ratings?
- What does the phrase ‘highest standard rating’ mean to you?

_(Both versions)_
- What do you think you would do after reading the message about ratings at the highest level?
- What do you think you might do after reviewing this screen?
- What if your migraines had gotten worse - what do you think you could do?
- What do you think you might do here to potentially increase your overall rating?
- This is the last screen for this prototype. Before we go to the next one, can you tell me if reading that information would influence your decision to file a claim for increase? 

**Things to watch for:**
Does the intervention discourage them from claiming tinnitus and/or arthritis? 

## Scenario 2: Request CFI for Tinnitus - 15 minutes 

**If this is the 1st task:** 
Your Tinnitus and degenerative arthritis have gotten worse, so you’re planning to ask for more compensation. I’d like you to walk us through what you would do on this prototype. Please think aloud as much as you can while you are walking us through this process. And we’re not in a hurry, so take as much time as you would if you were actually doing this for yourself. 

**If this is the 2nd task:** 
Similar to the last task, in this scenario your Tinnitus and degenerative arthritis have gotten worse and you’re planning to ask for more compensation.

### Screen 1 (Start)
Do you have any questions before you start?
Go ahead and click Version 2.

### Screen 2 (Veteran Details screen)
As I mentioned before, this is fake data. You can imagine this is your personal information. Go ahead and show me how you would get started.

### Screen 3 (New or Increase) → Screen 4 (New or Increase)
Talk me through what you would do on this screen.

### Screen 5 (Select conditions)
Thanks for that! Go ahead and show me what you would do on this screen, but pause before hitting ‘Continue’ as I will have a few questions for you on this screen.
- What can you tell me about the conditions on this screen?
- What do you think about your eligibility for more benefits?
- Can you tell me about the header that mentions maximum ratings - what does that mean to you?
- What does the phrase ‘Maximum Possible Rating’ mean to you?
- What do you think you would do next?

_Moderator note: Encourage participant to open expando if they have not already_
- What is this text telling you? What do you think you would do after reading it?
- This is the last screen for this prototype. Before we go to the next one, can you tell me if reading that information would influence your decision to file a claim for increase? 

**Things to watch for:**
- Does the intervention discourage them from claiming tinnitus? 
- Do they find knowing the maximum possible rating for all conditions helpful/useful?

## Scenario 3: Request CFI for Tinnitus with Friction - 15 minutes 

**If this is the 1st task:** 
Your Tinnitus and degenerative arthritis have gotten worse, so you’re planning to ask for more compensation. I’d like you to walk us through what you would do on this prototype. Please think aloud as much as you can while you are walking us through this process. And we’re not in a hurry, so take as much time as you would if you were actually doing this for yourself. Also note that in the prototype, we are starting you in the middle of the claims process just to save time.  

**If this is the 2nd task:** 
Similar to the last task, in this scenario your Tinnitus and degenerative arthritis have gotten worse and you’re planning to ask for more compensation. 

### Screen 1 (Start)
Do you have any questions before you start?
Go ahead and click Version 3.

### Screen 2 (Veteran Details screen)
Go ahead and show me how you would get started.

### Screen 3 (New or Increase) → Screen 4 (New or Increase)
Talk me through what you would do on this screen.

### Screen 5 (Select conditions)
Thanks for that! Go ahead and show me what you would do on this screen, but pause before hitting ‘Continue’ as I will have a few questions for you on this screen.
- What can you tell me about the conditions on this screen?
- What do you think about your eligibility for more benefits?
- Can you tell me about the messaging for Tinnitus and what you think it means?
- What do you think you would do after reading that message about Tinnitus?

_Moderator note: Encourage participant to select ‘Tinnitus’ even if they say they wouldn’t._
  
Go ahead and click on ‘Continue’

### Screen 6 (Tinnitus Friction)
- Can you tell me what this page is about?

_Moderator note: Encourage participant to open expando if they have not already_

- What is this text telling you? 
- What do you think you would do next?
- This is the last screen for this prototype. Before we go to the next one, can you tell me if reading that information would influence your decision to file a claim for increase? 

**Things to watch for:**
Does the intervention discourage them from claiming tinnitus? 

## Compare prototypes
- Now that you’ve looked at the two different prototypes, can you tell me about the differences in how you experienced each of them?
- Between these two prototypes, which do you think would be more likely to influence your decision about whether or not to submit a claim for increase on Tinnitus or other conditions?

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. 
- In general, I’d love to hear what do you think about your overall experience - being scheduled for this research session, participating in the research session. Could we have done anything differently/better?
