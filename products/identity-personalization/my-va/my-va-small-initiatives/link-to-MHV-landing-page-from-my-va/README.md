## Overview
The health wayfinding study from earlier in 2023 showed that some folks had a hard time finding/navigating to the new MHV landing page from My VA, and therefore had a hard time finding additional health information not shown on My VA.

We'll be adding some form of a "view all" link (content and mechanism tbd) to the Health Care section on My VA which will navigate users to the new MHV landing page on va.gov. We'll also be exploring this concept of "view all/more" acroess the other benefits on My VA to make sure we are making the experience as consistent as possible. 

Specifically for the health care section, once we add this link, we'll monitor the existing secondary links we currently display on My VA to see if engagement on those declines. This would indicate that they aren't needed and users are finding what they need from the link that navigates them to the MHV landing page.

## Measuring Success

### Objective: Streamline a user's navigation from My VA to the new MHV landing page from within the health care section on My VA

#### Hypothesis 1: Users prefer to execute health care related tasks and action items from the MHV landing page versus the links provided on My VA.

**Key Result: We see a decline in engagement on the health care secondary links on My VA** (_within margin as determined by average fluctuation prior to launch_)

#### Hypothesis 2: We will initially see significant engagement with the new link to MHV

**Key Result: Task completion/initiation from MHV landing page increases after navigating to MHV landing page from My VA**

TBD how best to capture and display this as a KPI but we'll need to create a funnel or next page report to track the following paths:
- My VA > MHV landing page from new My VA link > Inbox > start/complete a task
- My VA > MHV landing page from new My VA link > Appointments tool > start/complete a task
- My VA > MHV landing page from new My VA link > Prescriptions tool > start/complete a task
- My VA > MHV landing page from new My VA link > Travel reimbursement tool > start/complete a task
- My VA > MHV landing page from new My VA link > Medical records, lab/test results > start/complete a task
