## Overview
*Streamlining the Veteran application routing experience by improving the How to Apply Wizard to be an authenticated tool accessible through the how to apply page and eligibility on Vet EDU homepage.*

## Problem Statement
*In a couple of sentences, describe the Who, What, Why, and Where of the challenge / pain point you seek to address.
Who: Veterans and their family members
What:  Looking for the correct education application forms to apply for from the Va.Gov Education section
Why: The current wizard is long-documented as a pain point in the application experience; the design component is also deprecated in Va.Gov's design system.
Where: Replacing the functionality of the how to apply wizard that appears on edu's how to apply section and eligibility
 
## Desired User Outcomes

Overall faster, easier, and more accurate application routing experience for a Veteran or their family member coming to this site, looking to apply for benefits

## Undesired User Outcomes

Further confusing prospective applicants or pushing them down the wrong path

## Desired Business Outcomes

Increased access to education benefit opportunities; better overall Veteran education journey experience

## Undesired Business Outcomes

## Measuring Success

Google analytics, My Education Benefits application #s over time; automation rates

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* TBD


## Assumptions

Our Education application recommender tool would be a near 1:1 replacement with the current wizard. We have assumptions about what the authenticated experience can pull re: information for the propsective applicant that accurately recommends the best app for them. This relies on (statistical) heuristics. 

## Solution Approach

We'd like to present a series of "checks" (Alla turbotax) for the prospective applicant to view info we have on file and ultimately give them a primary and secondary recommendation for the best application suited for them to go forth in applying for.

## Launch Strategy

TBD but will include Organizational Change mgmt, training, and communications package


## Launch Dates
- ideally around 12/24

### Current Status

High fidelity wireframes have been produced, business logic has been written as to how recommendations would accurately be presented, we've talked to the IA and Content teams about language framing around the tool.
