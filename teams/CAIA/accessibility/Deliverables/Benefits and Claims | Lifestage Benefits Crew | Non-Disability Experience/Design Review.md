• Color checks all seem to be in line and consistent with VADS. <br>
• Buttons and links seem to be used consistently, limited links within form. (Be mindful of interchanging these functions and always remember Links _GO_ and buttons _DO_) <br>
• Cognitive flow: complex information with multiple users, requiring specific knowledge or financial information. <br>
    • Create unique headings for sub steps (this will help inform URLS/IA and be beneficial for users to feel progression through form) <br>
    • Favor language to be person centric <br>
    • review steps and sub steps holistically ensure that when asking about additional family memebers the order you ask is consistent across steps <br>
    • think about fidelity and complexity of questions and review overal form questions order (moving contact information into step one with applicant info instead of last?) <br>
    • review and clarify what is required to fill out and waht is optional/addtional data <br>
• Review consistency across steps in language and overal layout (using H2 headings, and typography for the heading) <br>
• navigation currently looks logical and functional will need to check with keyboard once in staging later on (when passing work to DEV share suggested Heading structure in annotations) <br>
