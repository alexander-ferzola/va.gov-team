# How to publish an update to the H1 of a resources and support article

The Drupal CMS automatically creates the URL for a resources and support page from the H1. So if we update the H1 on an R&S page, the URL will also change. To avoid broken links to the old URL, we use this process:

1. First, make sure the H1 change is necessary. Before changing the H1, consult with IA about the need for a redirect.
2. Move the updated page content into a new node in Drupal, so that the change will create a new URL without overwriting the old one. 
3. Publish the page in the new node. 
4. Request a redirect from the old URL to the new one.
5. Do an audit of links to the old URL on our static pages, and update them to the new URL.
6. When the redirect is live, archive the old node in Drupal. 
7. The sitemap should be automatically updated and will have removed the old URL, but reach out to Public Websites to confirm.

**Note:** If the old R&S page is high profile or has inaccurate information that could lead to negative consequences for Veterans, consider adding an info alert to the top of the old page while we're waiting for the redirect. The alert could note that the page is out of date, and link people to the new page for updated information.
